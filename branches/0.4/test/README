Started 6/23/2009

===========================
       Sample Data
===========================
All unit test provided use the Employee Sample data provided by MySQL.
Make sure that the data is imported using InnoDB. This allows for 
transaction based tests.

To get a copy of this data visit 1 of the following URLs:
	http://launchpad.net/test-db
	http://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/employee.html
	http://dev.mysql.com/doc/#sampledb
	
You will also need to create a user with the following info
	U: unittest
	P: zEzaj37u
	This user also needs full permissions to the, what should now be created, employees schema
	This use can be created for localhost access only or remote access. 
	Just make sure that the user can connect to this db from the location you wish to run the tests.
